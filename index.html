                    <h3>Design + Development</h3>
                    <p> While attending the University of Toronto, I was able to learn the theoretical aspects
                        of statistics, mathematics, and computer science. However, there were not many opportunities
                        within the school curriculum to apply, and implement these techniques into real-life scenarios
                        and needs. In this respect, I began designing, and implementing personal projects and algorithms, 
                        exercising in practical application. Since various tasks involve different types of knowledge,
                        the constant motivation towards real-life application has taught me numerous ideas and techniques.
                        I am currently interested in designing and developing 
                        projects and tasks related to machine learning, statistical analysis, data mining, and full-stack.

                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Team Work</h3>
                    <p> Shortly after graduation, I wanted to partake in projects that were outside of my personal capacity,
                        and work with teammates, that I could trust for a long time. So I began contemplating potential team members that, although may be in a different
                        field, were thinking, and headed towards a common direction. Through much thought and consideration,
                        I was fortunate enough to unionise with two colleagues, and I work with them to this day. We are currently tackling tasks, that can
                        combine our specialites, such as data analysis, machine learning, and full-stack development to
                        sharpen our cooperative skills, and solve larger tasks that require multiple skillsets.

                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Personal Work</h3>
                    <p> I have designed, and implemented numerous neural network algorithms, such as a video-game AI, pixel 
                        classification model, and a text-classifier. I have also implemented common
                        techniques, such as linear regression, SVM, KNN, and K Means in practical scenarios, with existing data.
                        I made statistical analysis on various data, such as market value, and behavioural studies utilizing R,
                        and implemented websites and applications with the purpose of learning the front and back-end structures. 
                        The notable languages and programs that I currently use are: HTML, CSS, JS, Python, R, Java,
                        MySQL, Tensorflow, keras, sklearn, Android Studio, and Git BASH for collaboration.

                <p> I am Won Tae(Andy) Jung, a recent graduate from the University of Toronto. I specialized in statistical data mining and machine learning, and I wish to
                    eventually work in a relevant field, such as machine learning, data science, and full-stack development.
                </p>
                <p> I am especially interested in machine learning. Initially, I began as a computer science student, but was quickly fascinated by the capabilities, and
                    work processes in the machine learning field, and I am certain of its potential in the future, as I believe it will change numerous lives and industries.
                    One day, I hope to become a competent professional myself, to help solve the problems and needs in the world, with this promising domain.
