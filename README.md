A repository for the development of a personal portfolio website, utilizing html/css + JavaScript.

This repository is linked via Netlify. I strongly suggest this tool for those who are looking to deploy a static website.

(The static website contained within this repository is deployed via Netlify, which is updated real-time by GIT BASH version control from my local drive)

The intention of this project is to learn, and solidify front-end development, while preparing portfolio content/a portfolio presentation medium.

  normalize.css -> For normalizing specifications between displays of different resolution and sizes

  style.css -> The main css file for organizing, and manipulating the presentation of the contents within the html file

img (folder) -> a folder containing all photos utilized

js (folder) -> a folder containing Javascript file(s)

  index.js -> Implements/handles events for the navigation menu constructed in index.html

index.html -> The main html file
